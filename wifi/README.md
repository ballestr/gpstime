WiFi is not a good idea for an NTP server.

But it can be the only option to place the antenna where it gets good satellite signal reception.

If the WiFi is also not good, there's a reconnect script to put in cron

All this is currently unused since I have good reception where ethernet is available. 
So the config files may have become obsolete for current Debian.
